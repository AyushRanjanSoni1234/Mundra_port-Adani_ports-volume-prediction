# Mundra_port-Adani_ports-volume-prediction
There are two mundra port and adani ports dataset. now i have created a model to show their turnover cost and deliverable volume which helps to predict the regression score of deliverable volume.
Here, I use the Pandas module, Seaborn, feature scaling("Sandarization") and Linear_Regression algorithms.
DataFrame is "ADANIPORTS".
